Sponsors or Patrons who contribute $5 per month will get access to pre-release (new) versions of the mod menu. 
- If you sponsor more than $5 a month, GitHub might not automatically invite you to the private repository. 
  - In that case, just open an issue on this repository using the account you're sponsoring with, and I'll send you an invite.
